# MyGallery
## About project
MyGallery is some sort of cloud where users can upload their images. Users can register, login (be remembered) and then they can upload images by choosing them from the explorer, pasting an image url or using drag'n drop functionality. Limitations are on file extensions (jpg, png and bmp) and on image size (16MB). Users can see their images in normal and gallery view (responsive lightbox). Users also can change some image and profile information.
